The architecture of the game will be divided into three main parts:

1. The game logic: This will include the classes and functions that handle the game mechanics such as generating the graph, handling user input, calculating the outcome of a trade, and updating the user's balance.

2. The user interface: This will include the classes and functions that handle the display of the game, including the graph, the user's balance, the outcome of each trade, and the admin area.

3. The data storage: This will include the classes and functions that handle the storage and retrieval of data such as the user's balance, the outcome of each trade, and the payout ratio.

The core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary are:

1. `GraphGenerator`: This class will generate the graph using a random number generator. It will have a method `generate` that will generate the graph.

2. `Trade`: This class will represent a trade. It will have properties such as `direction`, `betAmount`, `openPrice`, `closePrice`, and `outcome`.

3. `User`: This class will represent a user. It will have properties such as `balance` and a method `placeTrade` that will handle the user placing a trade.

4. `Game`: This class will handle the game logic. It will have methods such as `start` to start the game, `end` to end the game, and `calculateOutcome` to calculate the outcome of a trade.

5. `UI`: This class will handle the user interface. It will have methods such as `displayGraph` to display the graph, `displayBalance` to display the user's balance, `displayOutcome` to display the outcome of a trade, and `displayAdminArea` to display the admin area.

6. `DataStorage`: This class will handle the data storage. It will have methods such as `storeTrade` to store a trade, `retrieveTrades` to retrieve all trades, and `storePayoutRatio` to store the payout ratio.

Now, let's start with the "entrypoint" file, `main.py`. This file will import the necessary classes and start the game.

main.py
```python
from game import Game
from user import User
from data_storage import DataStorage

def main():
    # Create a user with an initial balance of 1000
    user = User(1000)

    # Create a data storage
    data_storage = DataStorage()

    # Create a game with the user and data storage
    game = Game(user, data_storage)

    # Start the game
    game.start()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Next, let's move on to the `game.py` file. This file will contain the `Game` class.

game.py
```python
from graph_generator import GraphGenerator
from trade import Trade

class Game:
    def __init__(self, user, data_storage):
        self.user = user
        self.data_storage = data_storage
        self.graph_generator = GraphGenerator()

    def start(self):
        # Generate the graph
        self.graph_generator.generate()

        # Display the graph
        self.user.ui.displayGraph(self.graph_generator.graph)

        # While the game is not over
        while not self.isGameOver():
            # Get the user's input
            direction, betAmount = self.user.placeTrade()

            # Create a trade
            trade = Trade(direction, betAmount, self.graph_generator.openPrice, self.graph_generator.closePrice)

            # Calculate the outcome of the trade
            self.calculateOutcome(trade)

            # Store the trade
            self.data_storage.storeTrade(trade)

            # Update the user's balance
            self.user.updateBalance(trade.outcome, trade.betAmount)

            # Display the outcome
            self.user.ui.displayOutcome(trade.outcome)

            # Display the user's balance
            self.user.ui.displayBalance(self.user.balance)

            # Display the admin area
            self.user.ui.displayAdminArea(self.data_storage.retrieveTrades(), self.data_storage.retrievePayoutRatio())

    def isGameOver(self):
        # The game is over if the user's balance is 0
        return self.user.balance == 0

    def calculateOutcome(self, trade):
        # If the closePrice > openPrice, AND the direction is 1 = win
        if trade.closePrice > trade.openPrice and trade.direction == 1:
            trade.outcome = "win"
        # If the closePrice < openPrice, AND the direction is -1 = win
        elif trade.closePrice < trade.openPrice and trade.direction == -1:
            trade.outcome = "win"
        # If the closePrice > openPrice, AND the direction is -1 = lost
        elif trade.closePrice > trade.openPrice and trade.direction == -1:
            trade.outcome = "lost"
        # If the closePrice < openPrice, AND the direction is 1 = lost
        elif trade.closePrice < trade.openPrice and trade.direction == 1:
            trade.outcome = "lost"
```

Next, let's move on to the `user.py` file. This file will contain the `User` class.

user.py
```python
from ui import UI

class User:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.balance = balance
        self.ui = UI()

    def placeTrade(self):
        # Get the direction and betAmount from the user
        direction, betAmount = self.ui.getTradeInput()

        # Subtract the betAmount from the balance
        self.balance -= betAmount

        return direction, betAmount

    def updateBalance(self, outcome, betAmount):
        # If the user won, add the betAmount multiplied by the payoutRatio to the balance
        if outcome == "win":
            self.balance += betAmount * self.ui.payoutRatio
```

Next, let's move on to the `ui.py` file. This file will contain the `UI` class.

ui.py
```python
class UI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.payoutRatio = 0.8

    def getTradeInput(self):
        # Get the direction and betAmount from the user
        direction = input("Enter the direction (1 for up, -1 for down): ")
        betAmount = input("Enter the betAmount: ")

        return direction, betAmount

    def displayGraph(self, graph):
        # Display the graph
        print(graph)

    def displayBalance(self, balance):
        # Display the balance
        print("Balance: ", balance)

    def displayOutcome(self, outcome):
        # Display the outcome
        print("Outcome: ", outcome)

    def displayAdminArea(self, trades, payoutRatio):
        # Display the trades and payoutRatio
        print("Trades: ", trades)
        print("Payout Ratio: ", payoutRatio)
```

Next, let's move on to the `data_storage.py` file. This file will contain the `DataStorage` class.

data_storage.py
```python
class DataStorage:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trades = []
        self.payoutRatio = 0.8

    def storeTrade(self, trade):
        # Store the trade
        self.trades.append(trade)

    def retrieveTrades(self):
        # Retrieve all trades
        return self.trades

    def storePayoutRatio(self, payoutRatio):
        # Store the payoutRatio
        self.payoutRatio = payoutRatio

    def retrievePayoutRatio(self):
        # Retrieve the payoutRatio
        return self.payoutRatio
```

Next, let's move on to the `trade.py` file. This file will contain the `Trade` class.

trade.py
```python
class Trade:
    def __init__(self, direction, betAmount, openPrice, closePrice):
        self.direction = direction
        self.betAmount = betAmount
        self.openPrice = openPrice
        self.closePrice = closePrice
        self.outcome = None
```

Finally, let's move on to the `graph_generator.py` file. This file will contain the `GraphGenerator` class.

graph_generator.py
```python
import random

class GraphGenerator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = []
        self.openPrice = 0
        self.closePrice = 0

    def generate(self):
        # Generate the graph
        for _ in range(10):
            self.graph.append(random.randint(0, 100))

        # Set the openPrice and closePrice
        self.openPrice = self.graph[0]
        self.closePrice = self.graph[-1]
```

The `requirements.txt` file will contain the necessary packages for the game.

requirements.txt
```
random
```

This is the complete architecture of the game. All parts of the architecture are present in the files.
